# Inventory Management System

The system maintains a comprehensive inventory database with each item characterized by attributes such as **name**, **price**, **quantity**, **weight**, and **value**.

### Binary Search:
Utilized for swift lookups of items based on their names, ensuring efficient retrieval.

### Merge Sort:
Employed to showcase the inventory in a neatly sorted order, facilitating ease of access and management. Sorting can be done based on criteria such as **name**, **price**, or **quantity**.

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm:
Applied for determining the most cost-effective routes for delivering items to diverse locations within the warehouse. Particularly valuable when considering paths with negative weights or costs.

### Knapsack Algorithm:
Employs dynamic programming to optimize the selection of items for shipment, considering constraints such as **weight** and **value**.
